# Hi, I'm Soon-yong Shim

I am an **M.S.-Ph.D. Integrated Student** in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at **Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)**. Building upon my undergraduate background in Business Management and Data Science from Yonsei University, my research now focuses on bridging theoretical deep learning with practical, resource-constrained deployments. 

My ultimate goal is to develop **Efficient & Robust Video Processing Architectures** suitable for **resource-constrained** AI environments. I value evidence-based methods, architectural optimization, and clear analytical reasoning.

## 🛠 Technical Skills
- **Languages**: Python, R, C++
- **Frameworks & Tools**: PyTorch, NumPy, Docker, pandas, Git, Linux, LaTeX
- **Focus Areas**: Deep Learning Architecture Optimization, On-Device AI, Video Restoration (Deblurring), Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Detection

## Research & Projects

### 1. Benchmark & Optimization for Video Restoration (MEDISYS Lab Intern)
*Conducted an extensive evaluation of SOTA video deblurring models, focusing on the trade-off between restoration quality (PSNR) and inference latency.*
- **Memory Optimization:** Resolved severe Out-of-Memory (OOM) issues in 3D CNNs by analyzing multi-branch activation map retention, successfully reducing memory footprints via patch size and channel dimension optimization.
- **Model Profiling:** Evaluated latency vs. PSNR, identifying the best model as the optimal balance for practical deployment.
- **Debugging & Open Source:** Handled dimension mismatch errors of open source models during training.

### 2. ZClassifier (OOD Detection)
*[`ZClassifier` Repository](https://github.com/ShimSoonYong/ZClassifier)* | *[arXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10638)*
- A probabilistic classifier using Gaussian-distributed latent logits for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.

## 🧠 Current Interests
Currently exploring how to make video processing lighter and smarter for Edge/On-Device environments:
- **Efficient Temporal Modeling:** Moving away from heavy 3D convolutions/attentions towards Latent Predictive Architectures (e.g., concepts from V-JEPA) and recursive Models.
- **Resource-Constrained Optimization:** Model compression and inference acceleration.
- **Robustness & Domain Generalization:** Ensuring stability in noisy, real-world vision tasks via generative priors and physics-based augmentation.
