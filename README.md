# Hi, I'm ShimSoonYong

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in **Business Management** and **Data Science** at Yonsei University MIRAE Campus. I'm trying to bridge statistical modeling, machine learning, and practical business problem-solving. I value evidence-based methods, reproducibility, and clear analytical reasoning. This GitHub space serves as my project archive and research portfolio.

## Technical Skills
- **Languages**: Python, R, C++
- **Tools**: PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, VSCode, RStudio, Jupyter, Git, LaTeX
- **Focus Areas**: Probabilistic modeling, deep learning, statistical inference, experimental design

## Featured Projects
- [`ZClassifier`](https://github.com/ShimSoonYong/ZClassifier) – A probabilistic classifier using Gaussian-distributed latent logits for robust OOD detection ([arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10638))
- `Artificial_Intelligence` – Assignments and implementations from an AI curriculum  

## Interests
Currently exploring:
- Gaussian-based classifiers and logit uncertainty modeling  
- Out-of-distribution detection and test-time regularization  
- Meta-learning and domain generalization in limited-resource settings  
- Medical image analysis and signal deblurring  

## 📫 Contact
Feel free to reach out via email: **[simsoonyong@yonsei.ac.kr]**  
I'm open to research collaboration, AI engineering opportunities, and applied analytics projects that require statistical depth and practical impact.
